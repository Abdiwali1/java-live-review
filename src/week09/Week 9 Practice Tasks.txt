Practice Tasks

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computer [Inheritance, access modifiers]
	Follow the steps to practice using the concepts and see how they work in the code

	Create a package access.a
	Create a class Computer in package access.a
		define the instance variables with access modifiers:
			os - public
			memory - protected
			brand - default
			has wifi card - private

		create a toString

	Create a class Windows in package access.a
		inherit the Computer class
		make a main method and create a Windows object. Check to see which variables are accessible

	Then make a class Runner in package access.a
		make a main method and create a Windows object. Check to see which variables are accessible based on their access modifier

	Create a package access.b
	Create a class Mac in package access.b
		inherit the Computer class
		make a main method and create a Mac object. Check to see which variables are accessible

	Create a RunnerB in package access.b
		make a main method and create a Mac object. Check to see which variables are accessible

OlympicSport [Inheritance, overriding, super constructor, static]

	Create a class OlympicSport

		instance variables
			- name (String)
			- participants (int)

		static variable: year of first Olympics: 1896
