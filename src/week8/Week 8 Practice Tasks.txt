Food [class, object, constructor, array]

    create a class called Food
        define these instance variables
            name, quantity, unit price, total price

       constructors
            - create a constructor that creates a Food object with the name
            - create a constructor that creates a Food object with the name and quantity
            - create a constructor that creates a Food object with the name, quantity, and unit price
                -> call calculatePrice() method here

       methods:
            - calculatePrice(): multiple the quantity by unit price and assign the value to the total price
            - toString()
                return all the Food information

    Create a separate class to create and test the Food objects
        try making an array of Food objects
        find all the Food objects that start with 'a' and print the Food object
        find all the Food objects that have a total price over 20 and print the name of the food

Planet [class, object, constructor, encapsulation]

    create a class called Planet
        define these instance variables
            name, mass, radius, number of moons, distance from sun (in AU - 1 AU is distance between sun and earth)

       constructors
            - create a constructor that creates a Planet object with the name
            - create a constructor that creates a Planet object with the name, mass, radius
            - create a constructor that creates a Planet object with the name, mass, radius, number of moons, distance from sun

       methods:
            - travel(): calculate how many year it will take to travel to the planet
                formula: distance from 72000000
            - toString()
                return all the Planet information

        bonus layer to discuss: classes as instance: continent, country, etc
